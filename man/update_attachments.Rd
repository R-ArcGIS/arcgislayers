\description{
Feature Services can contain attachments that are associated with a single feature ID. This function enables you to update the attachments of multiple features at once by generating multiple requests and performing them in parallel.
}
\details{
To rename or otherwise an attachment in a Feature Service, you must first download that attachment, modify the file on disk, and then upload it again. This is a limitation of ArcGIS Online and Enterprise. If you'd like to see this changed, please submit a community idea at \href{https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-online/ct-p/arcgis-online}{community.esri.com}.
