what api are we interested in representing?
are we interested in targetting the full suite of the rest api?
  - i think specifically data related work. So I/O analysis
  - i dont think search is all that important. particularly for fancy rendering
how do we handle raster? what is it going to look like 2 years from now from the R side?
python API covers some % of the REST API
it covers things like infra and admin etc.
how do we want this package to be delivered?
ArcObject vs REST API (?)
  - listing the portals can be reused from Pro
  - authenticate to portal etc.
