* This is a new release.
* This package imports arcgisutils 0.2.0 which was published on CRAN yesterday and may not have binaries for all distributions.
* ArcGIS is a brand name and not a software name which is why it is unquoted in the DESCRIPTION's description in "ArcGIS location services" and title.
* REST is not a software but an architecture so it is not quoted.
